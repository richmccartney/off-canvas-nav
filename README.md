Off canvas navigation for iOS, mobile devices and small screens. This simple plugin creates an off canvas style navigation. Giving an easier exerpeince for mobile device users. Optimised using gesture controls for the more experienced of mobile users. 

The layout uses my own <a href="https://github.com/richmccartney/1140-grid">1140 grid</a> template system, but the plugin can be extrapolated and used into your own projects.
